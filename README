This template is the ideal starting ground to build a single-purpose container using Dockerfile.

Just fill out the places indicated by the comments in the Dockerfile and _service files to get
started, then run osc vc (or use the web interface) to create a .changes file.

Compared to the container image template using kiwi, this (usually) requires use of a base image
with a package manager.
