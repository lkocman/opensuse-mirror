# Welcome to simple to deploy opensuse home mirror container

You might want to consider also looking into https://github.com/Firstyear/opensuse-proxy-cache
if you're on a tight space budget.


## Few clicks deployment

I'm using RaspPi 4 8Gb with 1TB SSD connected via USB with a clean install of Leap Micro 5.2 managed by a cockpit web interface.
https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/5.2/single-html/SLE-Micro-administration/#sec-admin-cockpit

* Simply access cockpit by https://$IPADDR:9090
* Go to podman containers and enable podman unless it's already enabled
* Click on Get new image
* Lookup lkocman-mirror
  *  Full URL registry.opensuse.org/home/lkocman/branches/opensuse/templates/images/15.4/containers/opensuse/lkocman-mirror
* 

I do recommend using a volume for /srv/pub/opensuse
See https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/

If you'd have a space budget, you can choose one of the hot stuff rsync modules by specifying:

```podman build --build-arg mirror_module=opensuse-hotstuff-160gb```

I plan to revisit and refresh these modules or utilize the exclude list which 
what I have been personally using at home.

Default mirror_module is opensuse-full, which will consume a few TB of space.
